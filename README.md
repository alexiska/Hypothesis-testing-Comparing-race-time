# Hypothesis-testing-Comparing-race-time

Blodomloppet is a race that is arranged in 18 locations around Sweden. The purpose is to draw attention to the vital blood donation and promote a healthy lifestyle. Participants can walk, jog or run 5 or 10 kilometers depending on their conditions. I first participated this race during my first professional year 2011 and then I attended again 2012 in Örebro.

In this project I have webscraped data for the race 2011 and 2012 for all the groups and race distance in Örebro and have been saved in Excel. Data has been analysed and hypothesis tests have been performed.

Three hypothesis tests are performed with T-test for the means of two independent samples between following groups:  
1.    Men 5km 2011 vs Men 5km 2012
2.    Women 5km 2011 vs Women 5km 2012
3.    Women 5km 2011 vs Men 5km 2011

The null hypothesis is that the averge time are equal and alternative hypothesis is that they are not equal.
